# Parking_Spots_Prediction
This repo contains a full project using Python to predict empty and full spots in a parking (See mp4 video of the parking). This project has been realized using SK-Learn and OpenCV. 


In this project I have developped a parking spots detector program, I have followed this dude (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-884J2mnOY) and I have applied what he did. I followed his tutos using his roadmap : (https://coggle.it/diagram/ZO5EUOut86Irr5hc/t/computer-vision-roadmap/760d909a1f28af1782645ff9b5af1dfd4481ce08bf258b4b54f868d7f3a1b8d5)

## How to?
First, you need to download this repo (all files are required). Second, you need to download the required libraries in "requirements.txt". Finally, you can excute "main.py".
